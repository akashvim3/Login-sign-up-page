#  Login and Sign-Up Pages

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a basic authentication module containing both login and sign-up pages. The module allows users to create accounts, log in with valid credentials, and manage session states securely.

### Features:
- **User Registration (Sign-Up)**: Allows new users to register by providing their details (e.g., username, email, password).
- **User Login**: Existing users can log in with their credentials.
- **Form Validation**: Frontend and backend validation to ensure valid input (e.g., strong passwords, unique email addresses).
- **Session Management**: After successful login, users are redirected to a dashboard or homepage.
- **Security**: Passwords are hashed before being stored in the database, and sensitive data is handled securely.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML/CSS
  - JavaScript (for form validation and UI interactions)
